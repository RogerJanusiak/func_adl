Query Operators
=====================

FuncADL is inspired by functional languages and C#â€™s LINQ. If you would like to learn more about LINQ, you can refer to the following resources:

FuncADL Query Operators
-----------------------------

In order to use FuncADL it is helpful to understand the query operators that are available. 

SelectMany
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the current stream's object type is an array or other iterable, return
the items in this objects type, one-by-one. This has the effect of flattening a nested array.

    Arguments:
        func:   The function that should be applied to this stream's objects to return
            an iterable. Each item of the iterable is now the stream of objects.

    Returns:
        A new ObjectStream of the type of the elements.

    Notes:
        - The function can be a ``lambda``, the name of a one-line function, a string that
            contains a lambda definition, or a python ``ast`` of type ``ast.Lambda``.

Select
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply a transformation function to each object in the stream, yielding a new type of
object. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input objects and output objects.

    Arguments:
    f: selection function (lambda)

    Returns:
    A new ObjectStream of the transformed elements.

    Notes:
    - The function can be a `lambda`, the name of a one-line function, a string that
    contains a lambda definition, or a python `ast` of type `ast.Lambda`.

SelectMany vs Select
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help illustrate the difference between `Select` and `SelectMany`, consider the following example:

Where
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filter the object stream, allowing only items for which `filter` evaluates as true through.

    Arguments:
    filter: A filter lambda that returns True/False.

    Returns:
    A new ObjectStream that contains only elements that pass the filter function

    Notes:
    - The function can be a `lambda`, the name of a one-line function, a string that
    contains a lambda definition, or a python `ast` of type `ast.Lambda`.

MetaData
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add metadata to the current object stream. The metadata is an arbitrary set of string key-value pairs. The backend must be able to properly interpret the metadata.

    Returns:
        ObjectStream: A new stream, of the same type and contents, but with metadata added.
